SCOPE AND TOPICS

DevOps has emerged in recent years as a set of principles and practices
for smoothing out the gap between development and operations, thus
enabling faster release cycles for complex IT services. Common tools
and methods used in DevOps include infrastructure as code, automation
through deep modeling of systems, continuous deployment, and continuous
integration. As of today, software engineering research has mainly
explored these problems from a functional perspective, trying to
increase the benefits and generality of these methods for the end users.
However, this has left behind the definition of methods and tools for
DevOps to assess predict and verify quality dimensions.

The QUDOS workshop focuses on the problem of how to best define and
integrate quality assurance methods and tools in DevOps. Quality covers
a broadly-defined set of dimensions including performance, reliability,
safety, survivability, cost of ownership, among others. To answer this
question, the QUDOS workshop wants to bring together experts from 
academia and industry working in areas such as quality assurance, agile
software engineering, and model-based development. The goal is to
identify and disseminate novel quality-aware approaches to DevOps.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 * Foundations of quality assurance in DevOps:
   Methodologies; Integration with life-cycle management; Automated tool
   chains, Architecture patterns; etc.
 * Quality assurance in the development phase:
   Software models in early software development phases; Languages,
   annotations and profiles for quality assurance; Quality analysis and
   prediction; Optimization-based architecture design; Architectural
   improvements; Performance anti-pattern detection; Traceability and 
   versioning; Software regression and testing; Performance change 
   detection; etc.
 * Quality assurance during operation:
   Application performance monitoring; Model-driven performance
   measurement and benchmarking; Feedback-based quality assurance;
   Capacity planning and forecasting; etc.
 * Applications of DevOps:
   Case studies in cloud computing, big data, and smart cyber-physical
   systems; Standardization and interoperability; Novel application
   domains.
 * All other topics related to quality-aware DevOps

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers that are 
not being considered in another forum.  We solicit full papers (max 
6 pages), short tool papers (max 2 pages), and extended abstracts 
overviewing a related project (max 1 page). A special session will 
be organised to showcase project posters for the extended abstracts.  
All submissions must conform to the ACM conference format. Each 
submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program 
Committee.

Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qudos2015

At least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the
workshop and present the paper. Presented papers will be published in
the ESEC/FSE 2015 proceedings that will be published by ACM and included
in the ACM Digital Library.

SUPPORT

The QUDOS workshop is supported by the Research Group of the Standard
Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC RG, research.spec.org) and
by the consortia of two EU projects, MODAClouds (modaclouds.eu) and
DICE (dice-h2020.eu).
